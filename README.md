# SQL-Nashville-Cleaning
The project's main objective was to improve a dataset related to Nashville's real estate market. It involved finding and fixing errors within the data to create a clean dataset suitable for viewing and analysis.

A breakdown of how this was achieved:

1. **Project Goals**: The primary aim was to ensure the dataset was free from errors. This involved pinpointing any existing issues within the data, proposing effective solutions, and implementing actions to rectify them, resulting in a clean and usable dataset.

2. **Setup Process**:
   - **Step 1**: Gathering data from the source.
   - **Step 2**: Importing the collected data into SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio).
   - **Step 3**: Identifying errors within the dataset.
   - **Step 4**: Cleaning the data by resolving these identified errors.

3. **Problem Statements Addressed**:
   - **Ensuring Correct Value Types**: Were all columns populated with the correct types of values?
   - **Handling NULL Values**: Were there any missing or NULL values that needed attention?
   - **Resolving Inconsistent Formats**: Did the dataset contain inconsistent values, such as spelling errors or variations in names for the same subjects?
   - **Optimizing Data Structure**: Could the original dataset be divided into smaller, more manageable tables to reduce storage space and improve performance?

Through these steps and addressing the specified issues, the project aimed to refine and enhance the Nashville real estate dataset, making it more reliable and efficient for analysis and interpretation.
